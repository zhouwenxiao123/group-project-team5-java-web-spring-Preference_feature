Our team is developing and deploying a meal preparation web application. This app will allow users to figure out their
meals in two different ways:
by finding a recipe based on ingredient they already have on hand, or by dynamically creating a grocery list of
ingredient they don’t have to be sent to a third party grocery delivery service. This recipe web application will also
be integrated into a calorie counting system for our calorie conscientious users.

We are using Java and Spring Boot to create the backend while integrating with Thymeleaf templates to 
integrate the front end UI. The application is being deployed using Heroku at https://meal-it.herokuapp.com/
